# `narinfo-tools`

This tool takes `.narinfo` files, and does things with them. Right now it can
convert `.narinfo` files to JSON records and also will one day sign things with
a Nix key. And maybe more.

It's implemented in Rust and targets **[WebAssembly System Interface][WASI]** by
default for portability â€” which allows its use even in more contexts (for
example, you can use it for foreign interfacing in any language with a WASI
implementation).

By default, **[Wasmtime]** is used for executing programs.
